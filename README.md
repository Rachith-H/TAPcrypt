# TAPcrypt
TapCrypt is a cryptographic system that uses a custom tap sequence as a unique encryption key to securely hide messages inside images. By combining hardware-based key generation with steganography, it ensures secure and undetectable communication, making data transfer more private and resilient to attacks.
